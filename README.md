# SimEmotion

The main codes are shown in the main.py file.

The requirements are the same as for CLIP (https://github.com/openai/CLIP).

The datasets and splits are referenced from the WSCNet(https://github.com/sherleens/WSCNet). Thanks again to JufengYang's and his team.

More information to be updated.
